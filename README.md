# Coherent-v2 Design System

A comprehensive design system built on Material-UI (MUI) that enables seamless design-to-code workflow through GitHub Copilot and Figma integration.

## Overview

Coherent-v2 is a modern design system that bridges the gap between design and development by leveraging:

- **Material-UI (MUI)** as the foundational component library
- **GitHub Copilot** coding agent for intelligent code generation
- **Figma MCP (Model Context Protocol)** for direct design-to-code transformation

## Features

- ðŸŽ¨ **Direct Figma Integration** - Convert Figma designs to React components automatically
- ðŸ¤– **AI-Powered Development** - GitHub Copilot pipeline for intelligent code generation
- ðŸ§© **MUI-Based Components** - Leverages Material-UI's robust component ecosystem
- ðŸ“± **Responsive Design** - Mobile-first approach with consistent theming
- ðŸ”„ **Reusable Components** - Modular architecture for maximum reusability

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Basic Usage

```jsx
import { ThemeProvider } from '@mui/material/styles';
import { coherentTheme } from 'coherent-v2';

function App() {
    return (
        <ThemeProvider theme={coherentTheme}>
            {/* Your components */}
        </ThemeProvider>
    );
}
```

## Workflow

1. **Design** - Create components in Figma using MUI design tokens
2. **Connect** - Figma MCP analyzes design specifications
3. **Generate** - GitHub Copilot creates corresponding React components
4. **Integrate** - Components are automatically optimized for the design system
